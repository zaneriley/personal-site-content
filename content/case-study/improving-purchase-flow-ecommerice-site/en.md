I was asked to increase the attach rate between Brit + Co’s two main products – Classes, offering instruction on topics like calligraphy, and Kits, supplies for projects and Classes.

When measuring the attach rate, it’s usually clear which product is primary and which is secondary. For example, smart phones are a primary product. Phone accessories, like cases, would be secondary. For Classes and Kits, however, the primary product wasn’t quite so obvious.

To increase the attach rate, we first had to understand which of our products was primary, and which one was secondary.

The relationship between specific Classes and Kits varied wildly. Some products worked together seamlessly, like the Calligraphy Class and Calligraphy Kit. Other pairings were less straightforward. Some classes had no kit, and some Kits had no matching class.

We couldn’t lock ourselves into a single pricing strategy while the company was exploring product/market fit. We would need to increase the attach rate without simplifying pricing or changing products.

One interesting piece of data helped shape our solution: How users viewed each product.

## User Flows

Users took different paths through the site depending on which product they were initially looking at. Take a look at the two flows below:

### How People View Classes

Users viewing Classes were likely to view and purchase Kits, but users viewing Kits were not likely to view or purchase Classes. They were unlikely to look outside the Kits page.

### How People View Kits

People seeking Kits may not need or want instruction; they could simply want supplies for their projects. People interested in Classes, on the other hand, seemed to also want all the supplies they need to begin learning that craft. We needed to make it easier for those viewing Classes to purchase related Kits, and we needed to convince those looking at Kits to view Classes as well.

## Alerting Users About Classes

For Kits that had a matching class, we added a callout that encourages users to view the class. Messaging was focused on making sure a user’s project turned out well.

## Bundling Both Products

The Class page allows people to purchase both Kits and Classes without leaving the class page.

On both pages, we removed content from the right rail so that only the add-to-cart module remained.

## User Testing

This was a clear direction, but we still needed to validate it with users, so I conducted a round of in-person user tests with 5 people.

> “Okay, Class and Kit… well that’s confusing, because it looks like it’s a price range, not a choice.”

The results showed we still needed to communicate our pricing structure more effectively. For instance, in the first user test below, Sophie couldn't understand the price range until she selected the drop down menu.

While I reported these findings to the team, Krystle revised the class page to better communicate the pricing structure. We tested again using a toggle instead of a dropdown menu, with much better results.

Simplifying the product pages and removing friction to purchase both the class and kit increased the attachment rate by 3.5%. We did it without inhibiting new strategy exploration for the rest of the team, and we saved engineering resources by building and deploying our own prototype.
