## Overview

Oddity serves as a homage to the influential video game series Mother, known in the US as Earthbound. Players embark on an adventure with a group of inexperienced kids to save the world from bizarre creatures and even stranger people.

## My Role
As the product designer and project manager for Oddity, I have a comprehensive role that includes overseeing the game's features, managing milestones, directing marketing and PR efforts, and serving as the community manager.

## Results
Our achievements during the project include:
- Capturing over 55K emails by March '15
- Surpassing 1,000,000 YouTube views with media coverage on Kotaku, Polygon, CrunchyRoll, and more
- Receiving overwhelmingly positive feedback from fans
- Reducing overhead costs by 90% by transitioning to a completely static site hosted on AWS S3, moving from Wordpress on EC2
- Decreasing the number of inquiries by 17% through strategic content influenced by CRM analysis
- Enhancing the battle interface to provide 16% more screen real estate and improved visual affordances

## Backstory
Mother, or Earthbound in the US, is a cult-classic with a rich history in video gaming. For further insight, Destructoid's article "EarthBound: So what's the big deal?" comes highly recommended.

## Challenges
### A. Maintaining a Strange Brand
Oddity needed to stay true to its roots while appealing to a new audience, balancing the quirky marketing of its predecessors with the expectations of modern indie games.

### B. Small Budget
With high hosting costs, finding ways to save without compromising quality was crucial. Switching to Amazon's S3 significantly reduced costs and loading times.

### C. Measuring Success
Initially lacking a baseline for success, we introduced an 'invite list' through Mailchimp as a key performance indicator.

## Maintaining a Strange Brand
Staying true to the Mother series meant embracing its unique branding while making it relevant for today's audience. We retained the iconic shade of red and introduced quirky taglines reminiscent of the original marketing.

## Indie Game Comparison
Balancing the series' legacy with the need to stand out among indie games in 2015, we focused on UX in our marketing efforts, a rare approach for indie games.

## Content Strategy
By analyzing over 5,000 fan emails, we crafted our content strategy to address common questions, reducing inquiries by 17%.

## Defining Success
The invite list became our measure of success, growing significantly through A/B testing and other optimizations.

## Improving the Battle Interface
By redesigning the battle UI, we increased screen real estate for battle backgrounds, enemies, and effects, enhancing player experience.
